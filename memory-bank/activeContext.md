# Active Context: Interactive Web Dev Tutorial App (Navigation Added)

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Implementing Section Navigation:** Adding a clickable stepper to allow users to jump between tutorial sections.
*   **Updating Documentation:** Ensuring Memory Bank files reflect the latest changes.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created `VideoEmbed.jsx` component.
*   Added copy-to-clipboard functionality for commands in `SimulatedTerminal.jsx`.
*   Updated `TutorialContainer.jsx` to render the `VideoEmbed` component based on step data.
*   Significantly expanded `tutorialSteps.js` with more detailed content, code examples, and video URLs.
*   Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` in the Memory Bank.
*   Removed "Simulating Feature Addition with a CLI" steps and achievement from `tutorialSteps.js`.
*   Refactored `TutorialContainer.jsx` to use MUI `Stack` for consistent content spacing.
*   Added `section` property to all steps in `tutorialSteps.js`.
*   Added `goToStep(index)` function to `TutorialContext.jsx` and exposed it in the context value.
*   Exposed the full `tutorialSteps` array in the `TutorialContext` value.
*   Implemented a clickable MUI `Stepper` in `TutorialContainer.jsx`, grouped by section, allowing users to navigate directly to steps.
*   Debugged and fixed "Invalid element type: undefined" error in `TutorialContainer.jsx` (caused by syntax error introduced during previous key prop fixes).
*   Attempted multiple strategies to resolve persistent "missing key" warning related to `MuiStepperRoot`, including adding keys to `Stepper`, `Step`, `StepLabel`, and wrapping `StepLabel` in a Fragment. Warning persists but no longer causes a crash.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` (Current step).
2.  Add comprehensive code comments throughout the new/modified components (`VideoEmbed`, `SimulatedTerminal`, `TutorialContainer`, `TutorialContext`, `App`, `CodeBlock`, `FileStructure`, `AchievementNotifier`).
3.  Review the application for consistency and clarity, especially the new stepper navigation.
4.  Consider adding syntax highlighting to `CodeBlock.jsx` (optional enhancement).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Content Scope:** Removed CLI simulation steps. Verified code block completeness.
*   **Visual Polish:** Improved layout and spacing in `TutorialContainer`.
*   **Navigation:** Added section-based stepper navigation for easier access to different parts of the tutorial.
*   **Video Integration:** Using provided YouTube URLs.
*   **Copy Functionality:** Implemented for code/terminal blocks.
*   **Memory Bank:** Actively updating documentation.
