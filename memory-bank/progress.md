# Progress: Interactive Web Dev Tutorial App (Navigation Added)

## 1. What Works

*   **Project Scaffolding:** Vite + React project (`web-dev-tutorial`) created.
*   **Dependencies:** Material UI and core dependencies installed.
*   **Memory Bank:** Initialized and updated with current project scope and structure.
*   **Core Structure:** `App.jsx`, `main.jsx` set up with Material UI `CssBaseline` and basic layout.
*   **State Management:** `TutorialContext` implemented using React Context API for managing step progression, completed steps, achievements, and providing a `goToStep` function. Full `tutorialSteps` array exposed.
*   **Persistence:** Tutorial progress (current step, completed steps, achievements) saved to and loaded from Local Storage.
*   **Content Structure:** `tutorialSteps.js` updated with `section` property for each step. CLI simulation steps removed. Code blocks verified.
*   **Content Rendering Components:**
    *   `TutorialContainer`: Displays current step content with improved spacing (MUI `Stack`). Implements a clickable MUI `Stepper` for section/step navigation. Fixed "Invalid element type" crash (syntax error). Persistent "missing key" warning related to `MuiStepperRoot` remains but doesn't cause crash.
    *   `CodeBlock`: Renders code snippets with copy functionality.
    *   `SimulatedTerminal`: Renders simulated terminal commands/output with copy functionality for commands.
    *   `FileStructure`: Renders file structure visualizations.
    *   `VideoEmbed`: Renders embedded YouTube videos.
*   **Achievements:** `AchievementNotifier` component implemented using MUI Snackbar to display notifications when achievements are unlocked.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   **Code Comments:** Add comprehensive, beginner-friendly comments throughout all `.jsx` and `.js` files in the `src` directory.
*   **Review & Refine:** Thoroughly test the application flow (including stepper navigation), review content for clarity and accuracy, and refine UI/UX as needed.
*   **(Optional) Syntax Highlighting:** Implement syntax highlighting for the `CodeBlock` component (e.g., using `react-syntax-highlighter`).

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Bug Fixing / Refinement.
*   **Current Step:** Fixed "Invalid element type" crash in `TutorialContainer.jsx`. Updated Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   **Next:** Add comprehensive code comments.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   ~~React crash ("Invalid element type: undefined") related to Stepper implementation.~~ (Fixed)
*   Persistent React warning: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop" pointing to `MuiStepperRoot`, despite keys being applied to `Step` components. (Non-critical, app functional).
*   Relies on external YouTube videos remaining available.
