# Project Brief: Interactive Web Dev Tutorial App

## 1. Core Objective

To create a modern, interactive tutorial application using Vite and React that guides absolute beginners (with no prior web development or GitHub experience) through the fundamentals of setting up a development environment, basic coding concepts, version control, and deployment. The app itself will serve as both the learning tool and the resulting project.

## 2. Target Audience

Absolute beginners to web development. Assumes no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Git, GitHub, or deployment platforms like Netlify.

## 3. Key Features

*   **Interactive Tutorial:** Step-by-step guidance through core topics.
*   **Vite + React Foundation:** Built using modern web technologies.
*   **NPM Basics:** Explanation and simulation of package management.
*   **Git & GitHub Integration:** Guided setup and basic commands.
*   **Netlify Deployment:** Step-by-step deployment guide.
*   **CLI Simulation:** Demonstrate adding features/pages via simulated CLI commands within the app.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Use local storage to save user progress.
*   **Achievements:** Award badges for completing major milestones.
*   **Modern UI:** Visually appealing interface using a component library (e.g., Material UI).
*   **In-Depth Content:** Detailed explanations for each topic.
*   **Comprehensive Code Snippets:** Provide copyable code examples, including full file contents where relevant.
*   **Clear Console Commands:** Show simulated terminal commands with copy functionality.
*   **Embedded Videos:** Include relevant tutorial videos to supplement explanations.
*   **Thorough Comments:** Explain code sections clearly for beginners.

## 4. Scope

*   **In Scope:** In-depth Vite/React setup, detailed npm usage, comprehensive Git/GitHub basics (init, add, commit, remote, push), detailed Netlify deployment guide, simple CLI simulation, local storage for progress/achievements, UI with Material UI, embedded videos for key concepts.
*   **Out of Scope:** Advanced Git/GitHub workflows (branching beyond main, pull requests), complex state management, backend development, database integration, user authentication (beyond GitHub/Netlify account creation guidance), creating original video content.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   A user with no prior experience can successfully follow the tutorial to:
    *   Understand the purpose of each tool (Vite, npm, Git, Netlify).
    *   Simulate setting up a project.
    *   Simulate basic Git commands.
    *   Understand the deployment process.
*   The application is functional, well-structured, and easy to navigate.
*   Progress and achievements persist across sessions.
